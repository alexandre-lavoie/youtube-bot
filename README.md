# YouTube Bot
YouTube Bot is an AI that attempts to fully automize the YouTube video making process. The goal is to have an AI that can create everything from thumbnail to video. Our training data will be YouTube trending videos. We will use the python Keras GPU library and later port the models to TensorFlow.js. Following is a decomposition of a YouTube video and the Neural Networks that I think should be used.

# What Makes a YouTube Video?

- Thumbnail - GAN
- Title - LSTM
- Video - GAN
- Description - LSTM

The project will be documented in a multi-part series on my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrLs1ZRMuUyURpd43iZsMWA.
